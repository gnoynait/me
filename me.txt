        Car Navigation Based on Taxi Drivers’ Experience                2013.2~2013.6 
        *       Model taxi drivers’ driving experience and predict the most likely 
                path chosen by taxi drives given source and destination;
        *       About 60% accuracy when path length less than 10 and 30% on average;
        *       Outstanding Graduation thesis
        Grouped Text Clustering Using HDP Gaussain Mixture Model       2014.12~2015.2
        *       Utilize the group information to improve the clustering result;

                scale datasets and streaming data; Many applications such as web 
                page clustering
        *       Improve normalized mutual information from 0.6 to 0.8

INTERN EXPERIENCE
        Alibaba, Display advertising department, Algorithm Engineer    2014.5~2014.12
        *       Proposed a method using prior distribution over URL prefixes to 
                classify webpages, at least 10% improvement in accuracy and 50x 
                faster in speed
        *       Proposed Hierarchical Dirchlet Gaussian Mixture Model and developed
                its online variational inference algorithm to cluster webpages, which
                can infer the number and parameters of clusters automatically
        *       Helped improving the advertisement auction mechanism to prevent some
                advertisers from monopolizing network traffic and many other 
                improvements in CTR estimation, user’s interests modeling and user
                partition
        A big data medical start-up team,  Algorithm Engineer           2015.4~2015.5
        *       Build models to learn how to diagnose diseases from patient’s
                records
                and medical documents, design disease symptom recommendation 
                algorithm, develop UI prototype.
        *       Top 6 diagnosis accuracy is about 0.7
